Minin is a Professor of Statistics at UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences and an Associate Director of the UCI Infectious Disease Science Initiative. After receiving PhD in Biomathematics at UCLA, he spent 10 years on faculty of the University of Washington before joining UC Irvine in 2017. Minin is interested in formulating stochastic models that can describe complex dynamics of biological systems and devising statistically rigorous and computationally efficient algorithms to fit these models to data. Minin is currently most active in infectious disease epidemiology, working on data integration for Bayesian inference of disease transmission model parameters and probabilistic forecasting. His other interests include phylogenetics, population genetics, and systems biology.
